# Potato & Banana Disease / Ripeness Classifier (EE04 Project)

This repository contains my **EE04 Project**, focused on building lightweight computer vision web applications to classify agricultural images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

As part of my EE04 coursework, I developed interactive classification models to evaluate leaf health and fruit status:
1. **Potato Leaf Disease Classifier:** Classifies potato leaf images into *Healthy* vs. *Early Blight*.
2. **Banana Ripeness Analyzer:** Evaluates banana images into *Ripe* vs. *Unripe* states.

The main objective was to create a functional end-to-end pipeline—from dataset sourcing and transfer learning to a mobile-responsive web app deployment.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Architecture

* **Framework:** Python, TensorFlow / Keras
* **Model Architecture:** MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning with custom binary classification heads)
* **Frontend UI:** Streamlit
* **Image Processing:** OpenCV / PIL, MobileNetV2 preprocessing utilities

## 🔍 Key Insights & Observed Limitations

Developing and testing these models highlighted important real-world computer vision behaviors:

### 1. Studio vs. Field Image Generalization (Domain Shift)
* The leaf disease classifier was trained primarily on studio-style dataset images (single leaf, isolated plain background, controlled lighting).
* **Observed Behavior:** When tested on real field photos (natural garden environments, outdoor sunlight, background soil, or multi-leaf clusters), the model can produce high-confidence false predictions due to background interference.
* **Takeaway:** Model confidence scores do not inherently measure out-of-distribution input validity. High accuracy on studio validation sets does not automatically translate to complex field settings without field-sampled training data.

### 2. Preprocessing Dependencies
* Using standard pixel normalization (`/ 255.0`) vs. model-specific preprocessing functions (`tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input`) directly impacts feature extraction accuracy when using transfer learning backbones.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Technical Observations

Building and deploying these lightweight vision pipelines provided critical engineering takeaways regarding model behavior in practical settings:

### 1. Robustness Against Visual Noise & Background Clutter

* Models trained exclusively on studio-style images (single leaf on a plain background) struggle when deployed in natural field conditions (soil, multi-leaf clusters, direct sunlight).
* **Observation:** Incorporating aggressive Data Augmentation (random rotation, shear, brightness variation, and zoom) significantly reduced false positive rates under real field conditions.

### 2. Fine-Tuning vs. Feature Extraction

* Unfreezing the top layer blocks of the pre-trained EfficientNetB0 backbone allowed the network to adapt better to localized biological patterns (e.g., small early blight lesions on potato leaves) compared to completely frozen feature extractors.

### 3. Preprocessing Dependencies & Deployment Latency

* Ensuring exact alignment between training preprocessing and inference pipelines (e.g., matching normalizations) was crucial for maintaining classification accuracy during live Streamlit deployment.

🔍 Findings and Limitations

Building and evaluating these models revealed several practical challenges commonly encountered in real-world computer vision applications.

1. Domain Shift Between Training and Real-World Images

The potato leaf disease model was trained primarily on images captured under controlled conditions, featuring single leaves against clean backgrounds with consistent lighting.

When tested on real-world field images containing complex backgrounds, varying lighting conditions, soil, or multiple leaves, the model occasionally produced high-confidence but incorrect predictions. This highlights the impact of domain shift, where a model performs well on data similar to its training set but struggles with unseen environments.

Key Insight: High confidence does not always indicate correct predictions. Achieving reliable real-world performance requires training on more diverse datasets that closely represent actual field conditions.

2. Importance of Proper Image Preprocessing

Model performance was significantly influenced by the preprocessing technique applied before inference. Using the MobileNetV2-specific preprocessing function produced better feature extraction and classification accuracy than simple pixel normalization ("/255.0").

Key Insight: Matching the preprocessing pipeline to the pretrained model architecture is essential for obtaining optimal results when using transfer learning.
